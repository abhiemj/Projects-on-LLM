Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n5 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\n1\\n1111\\n111111–1 Using Statistics\\nIt is better to be roughly right than precisely wrong.\\n—John Maynard Keynes\\nY ou all have probably heard the story about Malcolm Forbes, who once got lost\\nﬂoating for miles in one of his famous balloons and ﬁnally landed in the middle of acornﬁeld. He spotted a man coming toward him and asked, “Sir, can you tell mewhere I am?” The man said, “Certainly, you are in a basket in a ﬁeld of corn.”Forbes said, “Y ou must be a statistician.” The man said, “That’s amazing, how did youknow that?” “Easy,” said Forbes, “your information is concise, precise, and absolutelyuseless!”\\n1\\nThe purpose of this book is to convince you that information resulting from a goodstatistical analysis is always concise, often precise, and never useless! The spirit ofstatistics is, in fact, very well captured by the quotation above from Keynes. Thisbook should teach you how to be at least roughly right a high percentage of the time.Statistics is a science that helps us make better decisions in business and economicsas well as in other ﬁelds. Statistics teach us how to summarize data, analyze them,and draw meaningful inferences that then lead to improved decisions. These betterdecisions we make help us improve the running of a department, a company, or theentire economy.\\nThe word statistics is derived from the Italian word stato, which means “state,” and\\nstatista refers to a person involved with the affairs of state. Therefore, statistics origi-\\nnally meant the collection of facts useful to the statista . Statistics in this sense was used\\nin 16th-century Italy and then spread to France, Holland, and Germany. We note,however, that surveys of people and property actually began in ancient times.\\n2\\nT oday, statistics is not restricted to information about the state but extends to almostevery realm of human endeavor. Neither do we restrict ourselves to merely collectingnumerical information, called data. Our data are summarized, displayed in meaning-ful ways, and analyzed. Statistical analysis often involves an attempt to generalizefrom the data. Statistics is a science—the science of information. Information may bequalitative orquantitative. T o illustrate the difference between these two types of infor-\\nmation, let’s consider an example.\\nRealtors who help sell condominiums in the Boston area provide prospective buyers\\nwith the information given in Table 1–1. Which of the variables in the table are quan-titative and which are qualitative?\\nThe asking price is a quantitative variable: it conveys a quantity—the asking price in\\ndollars. The number of rooms is also a quantitative variable. The direction the apart-\\nment faces is a qualitative variable since it conveys a quality (east, west, north, south).\\nWhether a condominium has a washer and dryer in the unit (yes or no) and whetherthere is a doorman are also qualitative variables.\\nEXAMPLE 1–1\\nSolution\\n1From an address by R. Gnanadesikan to the American Statistical Association, reprinted in American Statistician 44,\\nno. 2 (May 1990), p. 122.\\n2See Anders Hald, A History of Probability and Statistics and Their Applications before 1750 (New Y ork: Wiley, 1990),\\npp. 81–82.', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 8}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1. Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n6 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\n4 Chapter 1\\nAquantitative variable can be described by a number for which arithmetic\\noperations such as averaging make sense. A qualitative (orcategorical)\\nvariable simply records a quality. If a number is used for distinguishing\\nmembers of different categories of a qualitative variable, the number\\nassignment is arbitrary.\\nThe ﬁeld of statistics deals with measurements—some quantitative and others\\nqualitative. The measurements are the actual numerical values of a variable. (Quali-\\ntative variables could be described by numbers, although such a description might bearbitrary; for example, N/H110051, E/H110052,S/H110053,W/H110054,Y/H110051, N/H110050.)\\nThe four generally used scales of measurement are listed here from weakest to\\nstrongest.\\nNominal Scale. In the nominal scale of measurement, numbers are used simply\\nas labels for groups or classes. If our data set consists of blue, green, and red items, we\\nmay designate blue as 1, green as 2, and red as 3. In this case, the numbers 1, 2, and3 stand only for the category to which a data point belongs. “Nominal” stands for“name” of category. The nominal scale of measurement is used for qualitative ratherthan quantitative data: blue, green, red; male, female; professional classiﬁcation; geo-graphic classiﬁcation; and so on.\\nOrdinal Scale. In the ordinal scale of measurement, data elements may be\\nordered according to their relative size or quality. Four products ranked by a con-\\nsumer may be ranked as 1, 2, 3, and 4, where 4 is the best and 1 is the worst. In thisscale of measurement we do not know how much better one product is than others,only that it is better.\\nInterval Scale. In the interval scale of measurement the value of zero is assigned\\narbitrarily and therefore we cannot take ratios of two measurements. But we can take\\nratios of intervals. A good example is how we measure time of day, which is in an interval\\nscale. We cannot say 10:00 \\nA.M. is twice as long as 5:00 A.M. But we can say that the\\ninterval between 0:00 A.M. (midnight) and 10:00 A.M., which is a duration of 10 hours,\\nis twice as long as the interval between 0:00 A.M. and 5:00 A.M., which is a duration of\\n5 hours. This is because 0:00 A.M. does not mean absence of any time. Another exam-\\nple is temperature. When we say 0°F, we do not mean zero heat. A temperature of\\n100°F is not twice as hot as 50°F.\\nRatio Scale. If two measurements are in ratio scale, then we can take ratios of\\nthose measurements. The zero in this scale is an absolute zero. Money, for example,\\nis measured in a ratio scale. A sum of $100 is twice as large as $50. A sum of $0 meansabsence of any money and is thus an absolute zero. We have already seen that mea-surement of duration (but not time of day) is in a ratio scale. In general, the intervalbetween two interval scale measurements will be in ratio scale. Other examples ofthe ratio scale are measurements of weight, volume, area, or length.TABLE 1–1 Boston Condominium Data\\nNumber of Number of\\nAsking Price Bedrooms Bathrooms Direction Facing Washer/Dryer?

Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n7 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\nIntroduction and Descriptive Statistics 5\\nSamples and Populations\\nIn statistics we make a distinction between two concepts: a population and a sample.\\nThepopulation consists of the set of all measurements in which the inves-\\ntigator is interested. The population is also called the universe .\\nAsample is a subset of measurements selected from the population.\\nSampling from the population is often done randomly, such that every\\npossible sample of n elements will have an equal chance of being\\nselected. A sample selected in this way is called a simple random sample ,\\nor just a random sample . A random sample allows chance to determine\\nits elements.\\nFor example, Farmer Jane owns 1,264 sheep. These sheep constitute her entire pop-\\nulation of sheep. If 15 sheep are selected to be sheared, then these 15 represent a sample\\nfrom Jane’s population of sheep. Further, if the 15 sheep were selected at random from\\nJane’s population of 1,264 sheep, then they would constitute a random sample of sheep.\\nThe deﬁnitions of sample andpopulation are relative to what we want to consider. If\\nJane’s sheep are all we care about, then they constitute a population. If, however, weare interested in all the sheep in the county, then all Jane’s 1,264 sheep are a sampleof that larger population (although this sample would not be random).\\nThe distinction between a sample and a population is very important in statistics.\\nData and Data Collection\\nA set of measurements obtained on some variable is called a data set. For example,\\nheart rate measurements for 10 patients may constitute a data set. The variable we’reinterested in is heart rate, and the scale of measurement here is a ratio scale. (A heartthat beats 80 times per minute is twice as fast as a heart that beats 40 times perminute.) Our actual observations of the patients’ heart rates, the data set, might be 60,70, 64, 55, 70, 80, 70, 74, 51, 80.\\nData are collected by various methods. Sometimes our data set consists of the\\nentire population we’re interested in. If we have the actual point spread for ﬁve foot-ball games, and if we are interested only in these ﬁve games, then our data set of ﬁvemeasurements is the entire population of interest. (In this case, our data are on a ratioscale. Why? Suppose the data set for the ﬁve games told only whether the home orvisiting team won. What would be our measurement scale in this case?)\\nIn other situations data may constitute a sample from some population. If the\\ndata are to be used to draw some conclusions about the larger population they weredrawn from, then we must collect the data with great care. A conclusion drawn abouta population based on the information in a sample from the population is called astatistical inference. Statistical inference is an important topic of this book. T o\\nensure the accuracy of statistical inference, data must be drawn randomly from thepopulation of interest, and we must make sure that every segment of the populationis adequately and proportionally represented in the sample.\\nStatistical inference may be based on data collected in surveys or experiments,\\nwhich must be carefully constructed. For example, when we want to obtain infor-mation from people, we may use a mailed questionnaire or a telephone interviewas a convenient instrument. In such surveys, however, we want to minimize anynonresponse bias. This is the biasing of the results that occurs when we disregard\\nthe fact that some people will simply not respond to the survey. The bias distorts theﬁndings, because the people who do not respond may belong more to one segmentof the population than to another. In social research some questions may be sensitive\\n—\\nfor example, “Have you ever been arrested?” This may easily result in a nonresponsebias, because people who have indeed been arrested may be less likely to answer the\\nquestion (unless they can be perfectly certain of remaining anonymous). Surveys', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 10}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1. Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n8 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\n6 Chapter 1\\nconducted by popular magazines often suffer from nonresponse bias, especially\\nwhen their questions are provocative. What makes good magazine reading oftenmakes bad statistics. An article in the New Y ork Times reported on a survey about\\nJewish life in America. The survey was conducted by calling people at home on aSaturday—thus strongly biasing the results since Orthodox Jews do not answer thephone on Saturday.\\n3\\nSuppose we want to measure the speed performance or gas mileage of an auto-\\nmobile. Here the data will come from experimentation. In this case we want to makesure that a variety of road conditions, weather conditions, and other factors are repre-sented. Pharmaceutical testing is also an example where data may come from experi-mentation. Drugs are usually tested against a placebo as well as against no treatmentat all. When an experiment is designed to test the effectiveness of a sleeping pill, thevariable of interest may be the time, in minutes, that elapses between taking the pilland falling asleep.\\nIn experiments, as in surveys, it is important to randomize if inferences are\\nindeed to be drawn. People should be randomly chosen as subjects for the experi-ment if an inference is to be drawn to the entire population. Randomization shouldalso be used in assigning people to the three groups: pill, no pill, or placebo. Such adesign will minimize potential biasing of the results.\\nIn other situations data may come from published sources, such as statistical\\nabstracts of various kinds or government publications. The published unemploymentrate over a number of months is one example. Here, data are “given” to us without ourhaving any control over how they are obtained. Again, caution must be exercised.The unemployment rate over a given period is not a random sample of any futureunemployment rates, and making statistical inferences in such cases may be complexand difficult. If, however, we are interested only in the period we have data for, thenour data do constitute an entire population, which may be described. In any case,however, we must also be careful to note any missing data or incomplete observations.\\nIn this chapter, we will concentrate on the processing, summarization, and display\\nof data\\n—the ﬁrst step in statistical analysis. In the next chapter, we will explore the the-\\nory of probability, the connection between the random sample and the population.Later chapters build on the concepts of probability and develop a system that allows usto draw a logical, consistent inference from our sample to the underlying population.\\nWhy worry about inference and about a population? Why not just look at our\\ndata and interpret them? Mere inspection of the data will suffice when interest cen-ters on the particular observations you have. If, however, you want to draw mean-ingful conclusions with implications extending beyond your limited data, statisticalinference is the way to do it.\\nIn marketing research, we are often interested in the relationship between adver-\\ntising and sales. A data set of randomly chosen sales and advertising ﬁgures for agiven ﬁrm may be of some interest in itself, but the information in it is much moreuseful if it leads to implications about the underlying process—the relationshipbetween the ﬁrm’s level of advertising and the resulting level of sales. An under-standing of the true relationship between advertising and sales—the relationship inthe population of advertising and sales possibilities for the ﬁrm—would allow us topredict sales for any level of advertising and thus to set advertising at a level thatmaximizes proﬁts.\\nA pharmaceutical manufacturer interested in marketing a new drug may be\\nrequired by the Food and Drug Administration to prove that the drug does not causeserious side effects. The results of tests of the drug on a random sample of people maythen be used in a statistical inference about the entire population of people who mayuse the drug if it is introduced.\\n3Laurie Goodstein, “Survey Finds Slight Rise in Jews Intermarrying,” The New Y ork Times, September 11, 2003, p.

Describe the scale of measurement of each variable, and statewhether the variable is qualitative or quantitative.\\n1–2 Percentiles and Quartiles\\nGiven a set of numerical observations, we may order them according to magnitude.Once we have done this, it is possible to deﬁne the boundaries of the set. Any studentwho has taken a nationally administered test, such as the Scholastic Aptitude T est(SAT), is familiar with percentiles. Y our score on such a test is compared with the scores\\nof all people who took the test at the same time, and your position within this group isdeﬁned in terms of a percentile. If you are in the 90th percentile, 90% of the peoplewho took the test received a score lower than yours. We deﬁne a percentile as follows.\\nThePthpercentile of a group of numbers is that value below which lie P %\\n(Ppercent) of the numbers in the group. The position of the P th percentile\\nis given by ( n/H110011)P/100, where n is the number of data points.\\nLet’s look at an example.8 Chapter 1\\nThe magazine Forbes publishes annually a list of the world’s wealthiest individuals.\\nFor 2007, the net worth of the 20 richest individuals, in billions of dollars, in no par-ticular order, is as follows:\\n4\\n33, 26, 24, 21, 19, 20, 18, 18, 52, 56, 27, 22, 18, 49, 22, 20, 23, 32, 20, 18\\nFind the 50th and 80th percentiles of this set of the world’s top 20 net worths.EXAMPLE 1–2\\nFirst, let’s order the data from smallest to largest:\\n18, 18, 18, 18, 19, 20, 20, 20, 21, 22, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 32, 33, 49, 52, 56\\nT o ﬁnd the 50th percentile, we need to determine the data point in position(n/H110011)P/H20862100 /H11005(20 /H110011)(50/H20862100) /H11005(21)(0.5) /H1100510.5. Thus, we need the data point in\\nposition 10.5. Counting the observations from smallest to largest, we ﬁnd that the10th observation is 22, and the 11th is 22. Therefore, the observation that would lie inposition 10.5 (halfway between the 10th and 11th observations) is 22. Thus, the 50thpercentile is 22.\\nSimilarly, we ﬁnd the 80th percentile of the data set as the observation lying in\\nposition ( n/H110011)P/H20862100 /H11005(21)(80/H20862100) /H1100516.8. The 16th observation is 32, and the\\n17th is 33; therefore, the 80th percentile is a point lying 0.8 of the way from 32 to 33,that is, 32.8.Solution\\n4Forbes, March 26, 2007 (the “billionaires” issue), pp. 104–186.

The median is thus a measure of the location\\norcentrality of the observations.\\nIn addition to the median, two other measures of central tendency are commonly\\nused. One is the mode (or modes\\n—there may be several of them), and the other is the\\narithmetic mean, or just the mean. We deﬁne the mode as follows.\\nThemode of the data set is the value that occurs most frequently.\\nLet us look at the frequencies of occurrence of the data values in Example 1–2,\\nshown in Table 1–2.

If you think of the data points as\\nlittle balls of equal weight located at the appropriate places on the number line, themean is that point where all the weights balance. It is the fulcrum of the point-weights,\\nas shown in Figure 1–1.\\nWhat characterizes the three measures of centrality, and what are the relative\\nmerits of each? The mean summarizes all the information in the data. It is the aver-age of all the observations. The mean is a single point that can be viewed as the pointwhere all the mass—the weight—of the observations is concentrated. It is the center ofmass of the data. If all the observations in our data set were the same size, then(assuming the total is the same) each would be equal to the mean.\\nThe median, on the other hand, is an observation (or a point between two obser-\\nvations) in the center of the data set. One-half of the data lie above this observation,and one-half of the data lie below it. When we compute the median, we do not considerthe exact location of each data point on the number line; we only consider whether itfalls in the half lying above the median or in the half lying below the median.\\nWhat does this mean? If you look at the picture of the data set of Example 1–2,\\nFigure 1–1, you will note that the observation x10/H1100556 lies to the far right. If we shift\\nthis particular observation (or any other observation to the right of 22) to the right,say, move it from 56 to 100, what will happen to the median? The answer is:absolutely nothing (prove this to yourself by calculating the new median). The exact\\nlocation of any data point is not considered in the computation of the median, only', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 16}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

The median is resistant to\\nextreme observations.\\nThe mean, on the other hand, is sensitive to extreme observations. Let us see\\nwhat happens to the mean if we change x10from 56 to 100. The new mean is12 Chapter 1\\n=29.1 +22+18+49+22+20+23+32+20+18)>20x=(33 +26+24+21+19+20+18+18+52+100 +27\\nWe see that the mean has shifted 2.2 units to the right to accommodate the change in\\nthe single data point x10.\\nThe mean, however, does have strong advantages as a measure of central ten-\\ndency. The mean is based on information contained in all the observations in the data set, rather\\nthan being an observation lying “in the middle” of the set. The mean also has somedesirable mathematical properties that make it useful in many contexts of statisticalinference. In cases where we want to guard against the inﬂuence of a few outlyingobservations (called outliers ), however, we may prefer to use the median.\\nT o continue with the condominium prices from Example 1–1, a larger sample of ask-ing prices for two-bedroom units in Boston (numbers in thousand dollars, rounded tothe nearest thousand) is\\n789, 813, 980, 880, 650, 700, 2,990, 850, 690\\nWhat are the mean and the median? Interpret their meaning in this case.EXAMPLE 1–4\\nArranging the data from smallest to largest, we get\\n650, 690, 700, 789, 813, 850, 880, 980, 2,990\\nThere are nine observations, so the median is the value in the middle, that is, in theﬁfth position. That value is 813 thousand dollars.\\nT o compute the mean, we add all data values and divide by 9, giving 1,038 thou-\\nsand dollars\\n—that is, $1,038,000. Now notice some interesting facts. The value 2,990\\nis clearly an outlier. It lies far to the right, away from the rest of the data bunched\\ntogether in the 650–980 range.\\nIn this case, the median is a very descriptive measure of this data set: it tells us\\nwhere our data (with the exception of the outlier) are located. The mean, on the otherhand, pays so much attention to the large observation 2,990 that it locates itself at1,038, a value larger than our largest observation, except for the outlier. If our outlierhad been more like the rest of the data, say, 820 instead of 2,990, the mean wouldhave been 796.9. Notice that the median does not change and is still 813. This is sobecause 820 is on the same side of the median as 2,990.\\nSometimes an outlier is due to an error in recording the data. In such a case it\\nshould be removed. Other times it is “out in left ﬁeld” (actually, right ﬁeld in this case)for good reason.\\nAs it turned out, the condominium with asking price of $2,990,000 was quite dif-\\nferent from the rest of the two-bedroom units of roughly equal square footage andlocation. This unit was located in a prestigious part of town (away from the otherunits, geographically as well). It had a large whirlpool bath adjoining the master bed-room; its ﬂoors were marble from the Greek island of Paros; all light ﬁxtures andfaucets were gold-plated; the chandelier was Murano crystal. “This is not your aver-age condominium,” the realtor said, inadvertently reﬂecting a purely statistical fact inaddition to the intended meaning of the expression.Solution', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 17}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

The two data sets also happen to have the same number of observations,n/H1100512. But the two data sets are different. What is the main difference between them?\\nFigure 1–3 shows data sets I and II. The two data sets have the same central ten-\\ndency (as measured by any of the three measures of centrality), but they have a dif-ferent variability. In particular, we see that data set I is more variable than data set II.\\nThe values in set I are more spread out: they lie farther away from their mean thando those of set II.\\nThere are several measures of variability, ordispersion. We have already dis-\\ncussed one such measure\\n—the interquartile range. (Recall that the interquartile range14 Chapter 1\\n7“Sector Snapshot,” BusinessWeek, March 26, 2007, p. 62.FVS\\nCHAPTER 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 19}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

The\\ninterquartile range for data set I is 5.5, and the interquartile range of data set II is 2(show this). The interquartile range is one measure of the dispersion or variability ofa set of observations. Another such measure is the range.\\nTherange of a set of observations is the difference between the largest\\nobservation and the smallest observation.\\nThe range of the observations in Example 1–2 is Largest number /H11002Smallest\\nnumber /H1100556 /H1100218 /H1100538. The range of the data in set I is 11 /H110021/H1100510, and the range\\nof the data in set II is 8 /H110024/H110054. We see that, conforming with what we expect from\\nlooking at the two data sets, the range of set I is greater than the range of set II. Set I ismore variable.\\nThe range and the interquartile range are measures of the dispersion of a set of\\nobservations, the interquartile range being more resistant to extreme observations.There are also two other, more commonly used measures of dispersion. These arethevariance and the square root of the variance\\n—thestandard deviation.\\nThe variance and the standard deviation are more useful than the range and the\\ninterquartile range because, like the mean, they use the information contained in allthe observations in the data set or population. (The range contains information only onthe distance between the largest and smallest observations, and the interquartile rangecontains information only about the difference between upper and lower quartiles.) Wedeﬁne the variance as follows.\\nThevariance of a set of observations is the average squared deviation of\\nthe data points from their mean.\\nWhen our data constitute a sample, the variance is denoted by s\\n2, and the aver-\\naging is done by dividing the sum of the squared deviations from the mean by n /H110021.\\n(The reason for this will become clear in Chapter 5.) When our observations consti-\\ntute an entire population, the variance is denoted by /H92682, and the averaging is done by\\ndividing by N.(And /H9268is the Greek letter sigma; we call the variance sigma squared.\\nThe capital sigma is known to you as the symbol we use for summation, /H9018.)Introduction and Descriptive Statistics 15\\nSample variance:\\n(1–3)\\ns2=an\\ni=1(xi-x)2\\nn-1\\nPopulation variance:\\n(1–4)\\nwhere /H9262is the population mean.σ2/H11005aN\\ni/H110051(xi/H11002/H9262)2\\nNRecall that x¯¯is the sample mean, the average of all the observations in the sample.\\nThus, the numerator in equation 1–3 is equal to the sum of the squared differences ofthe data points x\\ni(where i/H110051, 2, . . . , n ) from their mean x ¯¯.When we divide the\\nnumerator by the denominator n/H110021, we get a kind of average of the items summed\\nin the numerator. This average is based on the assumption that there are only n/H110021\\ndata points. (Note, however, that the summation in the numerator extends over all n\\ndata points, not just n/H110021 of them.) This will be explained in section 5–5.\\nWhen we have an entire population at hand, we denote the total number of\\nobservations in the population by N. We deﬁne the population variance as follows.', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 20}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1. Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n18 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\nUnless noted otherwise, we will assume that all our data sets are samples and do\\nnot constitute entire populations; thus, we will use equation 1–3 for the variance, and\\nnot equation 1–4. We now deﬁne the standard deviation.\\nThestandard deviation of a set of observations is the (positive) square\\nroot of the variance of the set.\\nThe standard deviation of a sample is the square root of the sample variance, and thestandard deviation of a population is the square root of the variance of the population.\\n816 Chapter 1\\nSample standard deviation:\\n(1–5) s=2s2=Han\\ni=1(xi-x)2\\nn-1\\nPopulation standard deviation:\\n(1–6) /H9268=2/H92682=Han\\ni=1(xi-/H9262)2\\nn-1\\nWhy would we use the standard deviation when we already have its square, the\\nvariance? The standard deviation is a more meaningful measure. The variance isthe average squared deviation from the mean. It is squared because if we just computethe deviations from the mean and then averaged them, we get zero (prove this with anyof the data sets). Therefore, when seeking a measure of the variation in a set of obser-vations, we square the deviations from the mean; this removes the negative signs, andthus the measure is not equal to zero. The measure we obtain\\n—the variance —is still a\\nsquared quantity; it is an average of squared numbers. By taking its square root, we\\n“unsquare” the units and get a quantity denoted in the original units of the problem(e.g., dollars instead of dollars squared, which would have little meaning in mostapplications). The variance tends to be large because it is in squared units. Statisti-cians like to work with the variance because its mathematical properties simplifycomputations. People applying statistics prefer to work with the standard deviationbecause it is more easily interpreted.\\nLet us ﬁnd the variance and the standard deviation of the data in Example 1–2.\\nWe carry out hand computations of the variance by use of a table for convenience.After doing the computation using equation 1–3, we will show a shortcut that willhelp in the calculation. Table 1–3 shows how the mean is subtracted from each ofthe values and the results are squared and added. At the bottom of the last column weﬁnd the sum of all squared deviations from the mean. Finally, the sum is divided byn/H110021, giving s\\n2, the sample variance. Taking the square root gives us s, the sample\\nstandard deviation.x\\n8A note about calculators: If your calculator is designed to compute means and standard deviations, ﬁnd the\\nkey for the standard deviation.

This happened naturally in Example 1–2, where we had a\\ngroup of four points with a value of 18, a group of three points with a value of 20,and a group of two points with a value of 22. In other cases, especially when wehave a large data set, the collector of the data may break the data into groups evenif the points in each group are not equal in value. The data collector may set some(often arbitrary) group boundaries for ease of recording the data. When the salariesof 5,000 executives are considered, for example, the data may be reported in theform: 1,548 executives in the salary range $60,000 to $65,000; 2,365 executives inthe salary range $65,001 to $70,000; and so on. In this case, the data collector oranalyst has processed all the salaries and put them into groups with deﬁned bound-aries. In such cases, there is a loss of information. We are unable to ﬁnd the mean,variance, and other measures because we do not know the actual values. (Certainformulas, however, allow us to ﬁnd the approximate mean, variance, and standarddeviation. The formulas assume that all data points in a group are placed in themidpoint of the interval.) In this example, we assume that all 1,548 executives inthe $60,000–$65,000 classmake exactly ($60,000 /H11001$65,000)/H20862 2/H11005$62,500; we estimate\\nsimilarly for executives in the other groups.\\nWe deﬁne a group of data values within speciﬁed group boundaries as a\\nclass.\\nWhen data are grouped into classes, we may also plot a frequency distribution of\\nthe data. Such a frequency plot is called a histogram.\\nAhistogram is a chart made of bars of different heights. The height of\\neach bar represents the frequency of values in the class represented by the\\nbar. Adjacent bars share sides.We demonstrate the use of histograms in the following example. Note that a his-\\ntogram is used only for measured, or ordinal, data.20 Chapter 1\\nManagement of an appliance store recorded the amounts spent at the store by the 184\\ncustomers who came in during the last day of the big sale. The data, amounts spent,were grouped into categories as follows: $0 to less than $100, $100 to less than $200,and so on up to $600, a bound higher than the amount spent by any single buyer. Theclasses and the frequency of each class are shown in Table 1–5. The frequencies,denoted by f (x), are shown in a histogram in Figure 1–5.EXAMPLE 1–7', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 25}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

The shape of the histogram does not change;\\nonly the labeling of the f(x) axis is different.\\nRelative frequencies —proportions that add to 1.00 —may be viewed as probabili-\\nties, as we will see in the next chapter. Hence, such frequencies are very useful in sta-tistics, and so are their histograms.\\n1–6 Skewness and Kurtosis\\nIn addition to measures of location, such as the mean or median, and measures of vari-ation, such as the variance or standard deviation, two more attributes of a frequencydistribution of a data set may be of interest to us. These are skewness andkurtosis.\\nSkewness is a measure of the degree of asymmetry of a frequency\\ndistribution.\\nWhen the distribution stretches to the right more than it does to the left, we say that thedistribution is right skewed. Similarly, a left-skewed distribution is one that stretches asym-\\nmetrically to the left. Four graphs are shown in Figure 1–7: a symmetric distribution, aright-skewed distribution, a left-skewed distribution, and a symmetrical distributionwith two modes.\\nRecall that a symmetric distribution with a single mode has mode /H11005mean /H11005\\nmedian. Generally, for a right-skewed distribution, the mean is to the right of themedian, which in turn lies to the right of the mode (assuming a single mode). Theopposite is true for left-skewed distributions.\\nSkewness is calculated\\n11and reported as a number that may be positive, negative,\\nor zero. Zero skewness implies a symmetric distribution. A positive skewness implies a\\nright-skewed distribution, and a negative skewness implies a left-skewed distribution.\\nT wo distributions that have the same mean, variance, and skewness could still be\\nsigniﬁcantly different in their shape. We may then look at their kurtosis.\\nKurtosis is a measure of the peakedness of a distribution.\\nThe larger the kurtosis, the more peaked will be the distribution. The kurtosis is cal-culated\\n12and reported either as an absolute or a relative value. Absolute kurtosis is22 Chapter 1\\n11The formula used for calculating the skewness of a population is .\\n12The formula used for calculating the absolute kurtosis of a population is .aN\\ni=1cxi-/H9262\\n/H9268d4\\nnNaN\\ni=1cxi-/H9262\\n/H9268d3\\nnNFVS\\nCHAPTER 1\\nCHAPTER 3', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 27}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

Check the applicability of Chebyshev’s theorem and the empirical rule for\\nthe data set in problem 1–15.1–7 Relations between the Mean \\nand the Standard Deviation\\nThe mean is a measure of the centrality of a set of observations, and the standard\\ndeviation is a measure of their spread. There are two general rules that establish arelation between these measures and the set of observations. The ﬁrst is calledChebyshev’s theorem, and the second is the empirical rule.\\nChebyshev’s Theorem\\nA mathematical theorem called Chebyshev’s theorem establishes the following\\nrules:\\n1. At least three-quarters of the observations in a set will lie within 2 standard\\ndeviations of the mean.\\n2. At least eight-ninths of the observations in a set will lie within 3 standard\\ndeviations of the mean.\\nIn general, the rule states that at least 1 /H110021/H20862k2of the observations will lie within\\nkstandard deviations of the mean. (We note that k does not have to be an integer.)\\nIn Example 1–2 we found that the mean was 26.9 and the standard deviation was11.83. According to rule 1 above, at least three-quarters of the observations shouldfall in the interval Mean /H11006 2s/H1100526.9 /H110062(11.83), which is deﬁned by the points 3.24\\nand 50.56. From the data set itself, we see that all but the three largest data pointslie within this range of values. Since there are 20 observations in the set, seventeen-twentieths are within the speciﬁed range, so the rule that at least three-quarters willbe within the range is satisﬁed.\\nThe Empirical Rule\\nIf the distribution of the data is mound-shaped —that is, if the histogram of the data is\\nmore or less symmetric with a single mode or high point —then tighter rules will\\napply. This is the empirical rule:\\n1. Approximately 68% of the observations will be within 1 standard deviation of\\nthe mean.\\n2. Approximately 95% of the observations will be within 2 standard deviations of\\nthe mean.\\n3. A vast majority of the observations (all, or almost all) will be within 3 standard\\ndeviations of the mean.\\nNote that Chebyshev’s theorem states at least what percentage will lie within\\nkstandard deviations in any distribution, whereas the empirical rule states approx-\\nimately what percentage will lie within kstandard deviations in a mound-shaped\\ndistribution.\\nFor the data set in Example 1–2, the distribution of the data set is not symmetric,\\nand the empirical rule holds only approximately.24 Chapter 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 29}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

In this section, we will see a few other ways of displaying data,some of which are descriptive only. We will introduce frequency polygons, cumulativefrequency plots (called ogives ), pie charts, and bar charts. We will also see examples of\\nhow descriptive graphs can sometimes be misleading. We will start with pie charts.\\nPie Charts\\nApie chart is a simple descriptive display of data that sum to a given total. A pie chart\\nis probably the most illustrative way of displaying quantities as percentages of a giventotal. The total area of the pie represents 100% of the quantity of interest (the sum of thevariable values in all categories), and the size of each slice is the percentage of the total\\nrepresented by the category the slice denotes. Pie charts are used to present frequenciesfor categorical data. The scale of measurement may be nominal or ordinal. Figure 1–9 isa pie chart of the percentages of all kinds of investments in a typical family’s portfolio.\\nBar Charts\\nBar charts (which use horizontal or vertical rectangles) are often used to display cat-\\negorical data where there is no emphasis on the percentage of a total represented byeach category. The scale of measurement is nominal or ordinal.\\nCharts using horizontal bars and those using vertical bars are essentially the same.\\nIn some cases, one may be more convenient than the other for the purpose at hand.For example, if we want to write the name of each category inside the rectangle thatrepresents that category, then a horizontal bar chart may be more convenient. If wewant to stress the height of the different columns as measures of the quantity of inter-est, we use a vertical bar chart. Figure 1–10 is an example of how a bar chart can beused effectively to display and interpret information.\\nFrequency Polygons and Ogives\\nAfrequency polygon is similar to a histogram except that there are no rectangles,\\nonly a point in the midpoint of each interval at a height proportional to the frequencyIntroduction and Descriptive Statistics 25', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 30}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

These techniques provide ways of looking at data to determinerelationships and trends, identify outliers and inﬂuential observations, and quicklydescribe or summarize data sets. Pioneering methods in this ﬁeld, as well as the nameexploratory data analysis, derive from the work of John W. Tukey [ John W.

It contains some\\nof the features of a histogram but avoids the loss of information in a histogram that\\nresults from aggregating the data into intervals. The stem-and-leaf display is basedon the tallying principle: | || ||| |||| ||||; but it also uses the decimal base of our numbersystem. In a stem-and-leaf display, the stem is the number without its rightmost digit\\n(theleaf). The stem is written to the left of a vertical line separating the stem from the\\nleaf. For example, suppose we have the numbers 105, 106, 107, 107, 109. We displaythem as30 Chapter 1\\nFVS\\n10 | 56779\\nWith a more complete data set with different stem values, the last digit of each num-ber is displayed at the appropriate place to the right of its stem digit(s). Stem-and-leaf displays help us identify, at a glance, numbers in our data set that have highfrequency. Let’s look at an example.\\nVirtual reality is the name given to a system of simulating real situations on a computer\\nin a way that gives people the feeling that what they see on the computer screen isa real situation. Flight simulators were the forerunners of virtual reality programs. Aparticular virtual reality program has been designed to give production engineers expe-rience in real processes. Engineers are supposed to complete certain tasks as responsesto what they see on the screen. The following data are the time, in seconds, it took agroup of 42 engineers to perform a given task:\\n11, 12, 12, 13, 15, 15, 15, 16, 17, 20, 21, 21, 21, 22, 22, 22, 23, 24, 26, 27, 27, 27, 28, 29, 29,\\n30, 31, 32, 34, 35, 37, 41, 41, 42, 45, 47, 50, 52, 53, 56, 60, 62\\nUse a stem-and-leaf display to analyze these data.\\nThe data are already arranged in increasing order. We see that the data are in the 10s,\\n20s, 30s, 40s, 50s, and 60s. We will use the ﬁrst digit as the stem and the second digit ofeach number as the leaf. The stem-and-leaf display of our data is shown in Figure 1–16.\\nAs you can see, the stem-and-leaf display is a very quick way of arranging the\\ndata in a kind of a histogram (turned sideways) that allows us to see what the datalook like. Here, we note that the data do not seem to be symmetrically distributed;rather, they are skewed to the right.\\nWe may feel that this display does not convey very much information because\\nthere are too many values with ﬁrst digit 2. T o solve this problem, we may split thegroups into two subgroups. We will denote the stem part as 1* for the possible num-bers 10, 11, 12, 13, 14 and as 1. for the possible numbers 15, 16, 17, 18, 19. Similarly, thestem 2* will be used for the possible numbers 20, 21, 22, 23, and 24; stem 2. will beused for the numbers 25, 26, 27, 28, and 29; and so on for the other numbers. Ourstem-and-leaf diagram for the data of Example 1–8 using this convention is shown inFigure 1–17 . As you can see from the ﬁgure, we now have a more spread-out histogramof the data. The data still seem skewed to the right.\\nIf desired, a further reﬁnement of the display is possible by using the symbol * for\\na stem followed by the leaf values 0 and 1; the symbol t for leaf values 2 and 3; thesymbol f for leaf values 4 and 5; s for 6 and 7; and . for 8 and 9. Also, the class con-taining the median observation is often denoted with its stem value in parentheses.EXAMPLE 1–8\\nSolutionCHAPTER 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 35}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

In cases wherethere are many observations with the same value (for example, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22, 22,22, . . .), the use of a more stretched-out display may be needed in order to get a goodpicture of the way our data are clustered.\\nBox Plots\\nAbox plot (also called a box-and-whisker plot ) is another way of looking at a data set in an\\neffort to determine its central tendency, spread, skewness, and the existence of outliers.\\nAbox plot is a set of ﬁve summary measures of the distribution of the data:\\n1. The median of the data\\n2. The lower quartile3. The upper quartile4. The smallest observation5. The largest observation\\nThese statements require two qualiﬁcations. First, we will assume that the hinges of the\\nbox plot are essentially the quartiles of the data set. (We will deﬁne hinges shortly.) The\\nmedian is a line inside the box.Introduction and Descriptive Statistics 31\\nFIGURE 1–17 Reﬁned\\nStem-and-Leaf Display for\\nData of Example 1–8\\n1* 1223\\n1. 55567\\n2* 011122234\\n2. 6777899\\n3* 0124\\n3. 57\\n4* 112\\n4. 57\\n5* 023\\n5. 6\\n6* 02\\nFVS\\nCHAPTER 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 36}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

If one or more observationsare farther away than that distance, they are marked as suspected outliers. If theseobservations are at a distance of over 3 times the interquartile range from the appro-priate hinge, they are marked as outliers. The whisker then extends to the largest orsmallest observation that is at a distance less than or equal to 1.5 times the interquar-tile range from the hinge.\\nLet us make these deﬁnitions clearer by using a picture. Figure 1–19 shows the parts\\nof a box plot and how they are deﬁned. The median is marked as a vertical line acrossthe box. The hinges of the box are the upper and lower quartiles (the rightmost and\\nleftmost sides of the box). The interquartile range (IQR) is the distance from theupper quartile to the lower quartile (the length of the box from hinge to hinge): IQR /H11005\\nQ\\nU/H11002QL.We deﬁne the inner fence as a point at a distance of 1.5(IQR) above the\\nupper quartile; similarly, the lower inner fence is QL/H110021.5(IQR). The outer fences\\nare deﬁned similarly but are at a distance of 3(IQR) above or below the appropriatehinge. Figure 1–20 shows the fences (these are not shown on the actual box plot; theyare only guidelines for deﬁning the whiskers, suspected outliers, and outliers) anddemonstrates how we mark outliers.32 Chapter 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 37}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

T o identify the location of a data set based on the median.\\n2. T o identify the spread of the data based on the length of the box, hinge to\\nhinge (the interquartile range), and the length of the whiskers (the range of the\\ndata without extreme observations: outliers or suspected outliers).\\n3. T o identify possible skewness of the distribution of the data set. If the portion\\nof the box to the right of the median is longer than the portion to the left of themedian, and/or the right whisker is longer than the left whisker, the data areright-skewed. Similarly, a longer left side of the box and/or left whisker impliesa left-skewed data set. If the box and whiskers are symmetric, the data aresymmetrically distributed with no skewness.\\n4. T o identify suspected outliers (observations beyond the inner fences but within\\nthe outer fences) and outliers (points beyond the outer fences).\\n5. T o compare two or more data sets. By drawing a box plot for each data set and\\ndisplaying the box plots on the same scale, we can compare several data sets.\\nA special form of a box plot may even be used for conducting a test of the equalityof two population medians. The various uses of a box plot are demonstrated inFigure 1–21.\\nLet us now construct a box plot for the data of Example 1–8. For this data set, the\\nmedian is 27, and we ﬁnd that the lower quartile is 20.75 and the upper quartile is 41.The interquartile range is IQR /H11005 41 /H1100220.75 /H1100520.25. One and one-half times this dis-\\ntance is 30.38; hence, the inner fences are /H110029.63 and 71.38. Since no observation lies\\nbeyond either point, there are no suspected outliers and no outliers, so the whiskersextend to the extreme values in the data: 11 on the left side and 62 on the right side. \\nAs you can see from the ﬁgure, there are no outliers or suspected outliers in this\\ndata set. The data set is skewed to the right. This conﬁrms our observation of theskewness from consideration of the stem-and-leaf diagrams of the same data set, inFigures 1–16 to 1–18.Introduction and Descriptive Statistics 33', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 38}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

These discrepancies in percentile and percentile rank computationsoccur because of approximation and rounding off. In Figure 1–22, notice that the50th percentile is 22, but the percentile rank of 22 is 47 . Such discrepancies will getsmaller as the size of the data set increases. For large data sets, the discrepancy will benegligible or absent.\\nHISTOGRAMS\\nA histogram can be drawn either from raw data or from grouped data, so the work-\\nbook contains one sheet for each case.

Another useful template provided in the CD isFrequency Polygon.xls, which is used to compare two distributions.\\nAn advantage of frequency polygons is that unlike histograms, we can superpose\\ntwo or more polygons to compare the distributions. \\nPIE CHARTS\\nPie chart.xls is one of the templates in the CD for creating pie charts. Note that the\\ndata entered in this template for creating a pie chart need not be percentages, andeven if they are percentages, they need not add up to 100%, since the spreadsheetrecalculates the proportions.\\nIf you wish to modify the format of the chart, for example, by changing the colors\\nof the slices or the location of legends, unprotect the sheet and use the Chart Wizard. \\nT o use the Chart Wizard, click on the icon that looks like this:  .

Box plot2.xls is the\\ntemplate that draws two box plots of two different data sets. Thus it can be used tocompare two data sets.

Comparing sales in\\nyears 2006 and 2007, Figure 1–25 shows that Y ear 2007 sales were consistently below\\nthose of Y ear 2006, except in April. Moreover, the Y ear 2007 sales show less variancethan those of Y ear 2006. Reasons for both facts may be worth investigating.\\nSCATTER PLOTS\\nScatter plots are used to identify and report any underlying relationships among\\npairs of data sets. For example, if we have the data on annual sales of a product and onthe annual advertising budgets for that product during the same period, then we canplot them on the same graph to see if a pattern emerges that brings out a relationshipbetween the data sets. We might expect that whenever the advertising budget washigh, the sales would also be high. This can be veriﬁed on a scatter plot.\\nThe plot consists of a scatter of points, each point representing an observation.\\nFor instance, if the advertising budget in one year was x and the sales in the same\\nyear was y , then a point is marked on the plot at coordinates ( x,y). Scatter plot.xls is\\nthe template that can be used to create a scatter plot.38 Chapter 1', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 43}), Document(page_content='Aczel−Sounderpandian: \\nComplete Business Statistics, Seventh Edition1.

Plotting every pair of them can be tedious, so it\\nwould be faster and easier if a bunch of scatter plots are produced together. The tem-plate Scatter plot.xls has another sheet named “5 Variables” which accommodatesdata on ﬁve variables and produces a scatter plot for every pair of variables. A glanceat the scatter plots can quickly reveal an apparent correlation between any pair. \\nUsing MINITAB for Descriptive Statistics and Plots\\nMINITAB can use data from different sources: previously saved MINITAB work-\\nsheet ﬁles, text ﬁles, and Microsoft Excel ﬁles. T o place data in MINIT AB, we can:\\n•T ype directly into MINITAB.\\n•Copy and paste from other applications.\\n•Open from a variety of ﬁle types, including Excel or text ﬁles.\\nIn this section we demonstrate the use of MINITAB in producing descriptive statistics\\nand corresponding plots with the data of Example 1–2. If you are using a keyboard totype the data into the worksheet, begin in the row above the horizontal line containingthe numbered row. This row is used to provide a label for each variable. In the ﬁrst col-umn (labeled C1) enter the label of your variable (wealth) and press Enter. By moving thecursor to the cell in the next row, you can start entering data in the ﬁrst column.\\nT o open data from a ﬁle, choose File\\n/H17012Open Worksheet . This will provide you\\nwith the open worksheet dialog box. Many different ﬁles, including Minitab worksheetﬁles (.MTW), Microsoft Excel (.XLS), data (.DAT), and text (.TXT), can be openedfrom this dialog box. Make sure that the proper ﬁle type appears in the List of Files ofT ype Box. Y ou can also use the Session window and type the command to set the datainto the columns.\\nFor obtaining descriptive statistics, you can type the appropriate command in the\\nSession window or use the menu.

Introduction and Descriptive StatisticsText\\n43 © The McGraw−Hill Companies, 2009\\n1–11 Summary and Review of Terms\\nIn this chapter we introduced many terms and concepts. We deﬁned a population\\nas the set of all measurements in which we are interested. We deﬁned a sample as a\\nsmaller group of measurements chosen from the larger population (the concept of ran-dom sampling will be discussed in detail in Chapter 4). We deﬁned the process of usingthe sample for drawing conclusions about the population as statistical inference.\\nWe discussed descriptive statistics as quantities computed from our data. We\\nalso deﬁned the following statistics: percentile, a point below which lie a speciﬁed\\npercentage of the data, and quartile, a percentile point in multiples of 25. The ﬁrst\\nquartile, the 25th percentile point, is also called the lower quartile. The 50th per-\\ncentile point is the second quartile, also called the middle quartile, or the median.\\nThe 75th percentile is the third quartile, or the upper quartile. We deﬁned the\\ninterquartile range as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. We\\nsaid that the median is a measure of central tendency, and we deﬁned two othermeasures of central tendency: the mode, which is a most frequent value, and the\\nmean. We called the mean the most important measure of central tendency, or loca-\\ntion, of the data set. We said that the mean is the average of all the data points and isthe point where the entire distribution of data points balances.\\nWe deﬁned measures of variability: the range, thevariance, and the standard\\ndeviation. We deﬁned the range as the difference between the largest and smallest\\ndata points. The variance was deﬁned as the average squared deviation of the datapoints from their mean. For a sample (rather than a population), we saw that this aver-aging is done by dividing the sum of the squared deviations from the mean by n/H110021\\ninstead of by n. We deﬁned the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\\nWe discussed grouped data and frequencies of occurrence of data points\\ninclasses deﬁned by intervals of numbers. We deﬁned relative frequencies as the\\nabsolute frequencies, or counts, divided by the total number of data points. We sawhow to construct a histogram of a data set: a graph of the frequencies of the data.\\nWe mentioned skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of the histogram of the data\\nset. We also mentioned kurtosis, a measure of the ﬂatness of the distribution. We\\nintroduced Chebyshev’s theorem and the empirical rule as ways of determining\\nthe proportions of data lying within several standard deviations of the mean.\\nWe deﬁned four scales of measurement of data: nominal\\n—name only; ordinal —\\ndata that can be ordered as greater than or less than; interval —with meaningful dis-\\ntances as intervals of numbers; and ratio —a scale where ratios of distances are also\\nmeaningful.\\nThe next topic we discussed was graphical techniques. These extended the\\nidea of a histogram. We saw how a frequency polygon may be used instead of a\\nhistogram. We also saw how to construct an ogive: a cumulative frequency graph\\nof a data set. We also talked about bar charts andpie charts, which are types of\\ncharts for displaying data, both categorical and numerical.\\nThen we discussed exploratory data analysis, a statistical area devoted to analyz-\\ning data using graphical techniques and other techniques that do not make restrictiveassumptions about the structure of the data. Here we encountered two useful tech-niques for plotting data in a way that sheds light on their structure: stem-and-leaf\\ndisplays andbox plots. We saw that a stem-and-leaf display, which can be drawn\\nquickly, is a type of histogram that makes use of the decimal structure of our numbersystem. We saw how a box plot is made out of ﬁve quantities: th e median, the two\\nhinges, and the two whiskers. And we saw how the whiskers, as well as outliers\\nand suspected outliers, are determined by the inner fences andouter fences; the\\nﬁrst lies at a distance of 1.5 times the interquartile range from the hinges, and thesecond is found at 3 times the interquartile range from the hinges.\\nFinally, was saw the use of templates to compute population parameters and\\nsample statistics, create histograms and frequency polygons, create bar charts and piecharts, draw box plots, and produce scatter plots.Introduction and Descriptive Statistics 41', metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 46})]\n"

      "ﬂoating for miles in one of his famous balloons and ﬁnally landed in the middle of acornﬁeld. He spotted a man coming toward him and asked, “Sir, can you tell mewhere I am?” The man said, “Certainly, you are in a basket in a ﬁeld of corn.”Forbes said, “Y ou must be a statistician.” The man said, “That’s amazing, how did youknow that?” “Easy,” said Forbes, “your information is concise, precise, and absolutelyuseless!”\n",
      "1\n",
      "The purpose of this book is to convince you that information resulting from a goodstatistical analysis is always concise, often precise, and never useless! The spirit ofstatistics is, in fact, very well captured by the quotation above from Keynes. Thisbook should teach you how to be at least roughly right a high percentage of the time.Statistics is a science that helps us make better decisions in business and economicsas well as in other ﬁelds. Statistics teach us how to summarize data, analyze them,and draw meaningful inferences that then lead to improved decisions. These betterdecisions we make help us improve the running of a department, a company, or theentire economy.\n",
      "The word statistics is derived from the Italian word stato, which means “state,” and\n",
      "statista refers to a person involved with the affairs of state. Therefore, statistics origi-\n",
      "nally meant the collection of facts useful to the statista . Statistics in this sense was used\n",
      "in 16th-century Italy and then spread to France, Holland, and Germany. We note,however, that surveys of people and property actually began in ancient times.\n",

      "T oday, statistics is not restricted to information about the state but extends to almostevery realm of human endeavor. Neither do we restrict ourselves to merely collectingnumerical information, called data. Our data are summarized, displayed in meaning-ful ways, and analyzed.

      "Nominal Scale. In the nominal scale of measurement, numbers are used simply\n",

      "may designate blue as 1, green as 2, and red as 3. In this case, the numbers 1, 2, and3 stand only for the category to which a data point belongs. “Nominal” stands for“name” of category. The nominal scale of measurement is used for qualitative ratherthan quantitative data: blue, green, red; male, female; professional classiﬁcation; geo-graphic classiﬁcation; and so on.\n",
      "Ordinal Scale. In the ordinal scale of measurement, data elements may be\n",
      "ordered according to their relative size or quality. Four products ranked by a con-\n",
      "sumer may be ranked as 1, 2, 3, and 4, where 4 is the best and 1 is the worst. In thisscale of measurement we do not know how much better one product is than others,only that it is better.\n",
      "Interval Scale. In the interval scale of measurement the value of zero is assigned\n",
      "arbitrarily and therefore we cannot take ratios of two measurements. But we can take\n",
      "ratios of intervals. A good example is how we measure time of day, which is in an interval\n",

      "5 hours. This is because 0:00 A.M. does not mean absence of any time. Another exam-\n",

      "100°F is not twice as hot as 50°F.\n",
      "Ratio Scale. If two measurements are in ratio scale, then we can take ratios of\n",
      "those measurements. The zero in this scale is an absolute zero. Money, for example,\n",
      "is measured in a ratio scale. A sum of $100 is twice as large as $50. A sum of $0 meansabsence of any money and is thus an absolute zero.

      "Samples and Populations\n",
      "In statistics we make a distinction between two concepts: a population and a sample.\n",
      "Thepopulation consists of the set of all measurements in which the inves-\n",
      "tigator is interested. The population is also called the universe .\n",
      "Asample is a subset of measurements selected from the population.\n",
      "Sampling from the population is often done randomly, such that every\n",
      "possible sample of n elements will have an equal chance of being\n",
      "selected. A sample selected in this way is called a simple random sample ,\n",
      "or just a random sample . A random sample allows chance to determine\n",
      "its elements.\n",
      "For example, Farmer Jane owns 1,264 sheep. These sheep constitute her entire pop-\n",
      "ulation of sheep. If 15 sheep are selected to be sheared, then these 15 represent a sample\n",
      "from Jane’s population of sheep. Further, if the 15 sheep were selected at random from\n",
      "Jane’s population of 1,264 sheep, then they would constitute a random sample of sheep.\n",
      "The deﬁnitions of sample andpopulation are relative to what we want to consider. If\n",
      "Jane’s sheep are all we care about, then they constitute a population. If, however, weare interested in all the sheep in the county, then all Jane’s 1,264 sheep are a sampleof that larger population (although this sample would not be random).\n",
      "The distinction between a sample and a population is very important in statistics.\n",
      "Data and Data Collection\n",
      "A set of measurements obtained on some variable is called a data set. For example,\n",
      "heart rate measurements for 10 patients may constitute a data set. The variable we’reinterested in is heart rate, and the scale of measurement here is a ratio scale. (A heartthat beats 80 times per minute is twice as fast as a heart that beats 40 times perminute.) Our actual observations of the patients’ heart rates, the data set, might be 60,70, 64, 55, 70, 80, 70, 74, 51, 80.\n",
      "Data are collected by various methods. Sometimes our data set consists of the\n",
      "entire population we’re interested in. If we have the actual point spread for ﬁve foot-ball games, and if we are interested only in these ﬁve games, then our data set of ﬁvemeasurements is the entire population of interest. (In this case, our data are on a ratioscale. Why? Suppose the data set for the ﬁve games told only whether the home orvisiting team won. What would be our measurement scale in this case?)\n",
      "In other situations data may constitute a sample from some population. If the\n",
      "data are to be used to draw some conclusions about the larger population they weredrawn from, then we must collect the data with great care. A conclusion drawn abouta population based on the information in a sample from the population is called astatistical inference. Statistical inference is an important topic of this book. T o\n",
      "ensure the accuracy of statistical inference, data must be drawn randomly from thepopulation of interest, and we must make sure that every segment of the populationis adequately and proportionally represented in the sample.\n",
      "Statistical inference may be based on data collected in surveys or experiments,\n",
      "which must be carefully constructed. For example, when we want to obtain infor-mation from people, we may use a mailed questionnaire or a telephone interviewas a convenient instrument. In such surveys, however, we want to minimize anynonresponse bias. This is the biasing of the results that occurs when we disregard\n",
      "the fact that some people will simply not respond to the survey. The bias distorts theﬁndings, because the people who do not respond may belong more to one segmentof the population than to another. In social research some questions may be sensitive\n",
      "—\n",
      "for example, “Have you ever been arrested?” This may easily result in a nonresponsebias, because people who have indeed been arrested may be less likely to answer the\n",

Pharmaceutical testing is also an example where data may come from experi-mentation. Drugs are usually tested against a placebo as well as against no treatmentat all. When an experiment is designed to test the effectiveness of a sleeping pill, thevariable of interest may be the time, in minutes, that elapses between taking the pilland falling asleep.\n",

Again, caution must be exercised.The unemployment rate over a given period is not a random sample of any futureunemployment rates, and making statistical inferences in such cases may be complexand difficult. If, however, we are interested only in the period we have data for, thenour data do constitute an entire population, which may be described.

      "group of four points with a value of 18, a group of three points with a value of 20,and a group of two points with a value of 22. In other cases, especially when wehave a large data set, the collector of the data may break the data into groups evenif the points in each group are not equal in value. The data collector may set some(often arbitrary) group boundaries for ease of recording the data. When the salariesof 5,000 executives are considered, for example, the data may be reported in theform: 1,548 executives in the salary range $60,000 to $65,000; 2,365 executives inthe salary range $65,001 to $70,000; and so on. In this case, the data collector oranalyst has processed all the salaries and put them into groups with deﬁned bound-aries. In such cases, there is a loss of information. We are unable to ﬁnd the mean,variance, and other measures because we do not know the actual values. (Certainformulas, however, allow us to ﬁnd the approximate mean, variance, and standarddeviation. The formulas assume that all data points in a group are placed in themidpoint of the interval.) In this example, we assume that all 1,548 executives inthe $60,000–$65,000 classmake exactly ($60,000 /H11001$65,000)/H20862 2/H11005$62,500; we estimate\n",

      "1–11 Summary and Review of Terms\n",
      "In this chapter we introduced many terms and concepts. We deﬁned a population\n",
      "as the set of all measurements in which we are interested. We deﬁned a sample as a\n",
      "smaller group of measurements chosen from the larger population (the concept of ran-dom sampling will be discussed in detail in Chapter 4). We deﬁned the process of usingthe sample for drawing conclusions about the population as statistical inference.\n",
      "We discussed descriptive statistics as quantities computed from our data. We\n",
      "also deﬁned the following statistics: percentile, a point below which lie a speciﬁed\n",
      "percentage of the data, and quartile, a percentile point in multiples of 25. The ﬁrst\n",
      "quartile, the 25th percentile point, is also called the lower quartile. The 50th per-\n",
      "centile point is the second quartile, also called the middle quartile, or the median.\n",
      "The 75th percentile is the third quartile, or the upper quartile. We deﬁned the\n",
      "interquartile range as the difference between the upper and lower quartiles. We\n",
      "said that the median is a measure of central tendency, and we deﬁned two othermeasures of central tendency: the mode, which is a most frequent value, and the\n",
      "mean. We called the mean the most important measure of central tendency, or loca-\n",
      "tion, of the data set. We said that the mean is the average of all the data points and isthe point where the entire distribution of data points balances.\n",
      "We deﬁned measures of variability: the range, thevariance, and the standard\n",
      "deviation. We deﬁned the range as the difference between the largest and smallest\n",
      "data points. The variance was deﬁned as the average squared deviation of the datapoints from their mean. For a sample (rather than a population), we saw that this aver-aging is done by dividing the sum of the squared deviations from the mean by n/H110021\n",
      "instead of by n. We deﬁned the standard deviation as the square root of the variance.\n",
      "We discussed grouped data and frequencies of occurrence of data points\n",
      "inclasses deﬁned by intervals of numbers. We deﬁned relative frequencies as the\n",
      "absolute frequencies, or counts, divided by the total number of data points. We sawhow to construct a histogram of a data set: a graph of the frequencies of the data.\n",
      "We mentioned skewness, a measure of the asymmetry of the histogram of the data\n",
      "set. We also mentioned kurtosis, a measure of the ﬂatness of the distribution. We\n",
      "introduced Chebyshev’s theorem and the empirical rule as ways of determining\n",
      "the proportions of data lying within several standard deviations of the mean.\n",
      "We deﬁned four scales of measurement of data: nominal\n",
      "—name only; ordinal —\n",
      "data that can be ordered as greater than or less than; interval —with meaningful dis-\n",
      "tances as intervals of numbers; and ratio —a scale where ratios of distances are also\n",
      "meaningful.\n",
      "The next topic we discussed was graphical techniques. These extended the\n",
      "idea of a histogram. We saw how a frequency polygon may be used instead of a\n",
      "histogram. We also saw how to construct an ogive: a cumulative frequency graph\n",
      "of a data set. We also talked about bar charts andpie charts, which are types of\n",
      "charts for displaying data, both categorical and numerical.\n",
      "Then we discussed exploratory data analysis, a statistical area devoted to analyz-\n",
      "ing data using graphical techniques and other techniques that do not make restrictiveassumptions about the structure of the data. Here we encountered two useful tech-niques for plotting data in a way that sheds light on their structure: stem-and-leaf\n",
      "displays andbox plots. We saw that a stem-and-leaf display, which can be drawn\n",
      "quickly, is a type of histogram that makes use of the decimal structure of our numbersystem. We saw how a box plot is made out of ﬁve quantities: th e median, the two\n",
      "hinges, and the two whiskers. And we saw how the whiskers, as well as outliers\n",
      "and suspected outliers, are determined by the inner fences andouter fences; the\n",
      "ﬁrst lies at a distance of 1.5 times the interquartile range from the hinges, and thesecond is found at 3 times the interquartile range from the hinges.\n",
      "Finally, was saw the use of templates to compute population parameters and\n",

      "2. Add an explanation for each statement made in part 1 above. For the\n",

He spotted a man coming toward him and asked, “Sir, can you tell mewhere I am?” The man said, “Certainly, you are in a basket in a ﬁeld of corn.”Forbes said, “Y ou must be a statistician.” The man said, “That’s amazing, how did youknow that?” “Easy,” said Forbes, “your information is concise, precise, and absolutelyuseless!”\\n1\\nThe purpose of this book is to convince you that information resulting from a goodstatistical analysis is always concise, often precise, and never useless! The spirit ofstatistics is, in fact, very well captured by the quotation above from Keynes. Thisbook should teach you how to be at least roughly right a high percentage of the time.Statistics is a science that helps us make better decisions in business and economicsas well as in other ﬁelds. Statistics teach us how to summarize data, analyze them,and draw meaningful inferences that then lead to improved decisions. These betterdecisions we make help us improve the running of a department, a company, or theentire economy.' metadata={'source': 'Business_Statistics_Complete_Business_St_aczel.pdf', 'page': 8}\n"
